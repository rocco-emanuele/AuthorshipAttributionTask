## How to use
1. Download Main.ipynb and Corpus.zip (extract the folder once downloaded, it contains the dataset used in the code) in the same directory
2. The program was written in Jupyter Notebook (version 6.5.4) and is ready to be run (just read the comments inside the program to understand what every cell does) but if you use a different set up be careful to have every library needed (the first cell of code contains all the libraries implemented)
